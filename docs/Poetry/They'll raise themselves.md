they'll raise themselves
once they turn eighteen
was the mentality
my parents had

in the meantime
they'll raise each other
that way
we won't have
to do any raising at all

yesterday I taught my niece
how to brew her own tea
but she already knew

her mother taught her many things
so she entered adulthood
as a new adult
and not as a newborn
