Little me is drowning 
Inside my own head 
I can't hear what she's saying 
I must go inside instead 

Slowly I step out
Of my own body and skin 
To pull the top off my own head 
And carefully peer in

My voice echoes in the darkness 
As I ask, "Are you there?"
All I hear is water
Splashing everywhere 

I don't have time to think 
Before I reach inside to save her 
She talks a mile a minute, 
"You are my one true savior!"

Now little me is full of trust 
And visits all the time 
Without a knock she comes right in 
She talks and cries and whines

Little me leaves quite a mess 
Right behind my eyes 
A flood of tears I can't explain 
A chorus of thoughtful sighs 

But instead of being rude 
And asking her to leave 
I let her come over unannounced 
I let her sit and grieve 

Eventually she simmers down
All her pent up knots unwound 
I no longer find her troublesome 
Or a burden to which I'm bound 

Don't ignore your little one 
Heed their cries, dive in 
Save them from the drowning 
So your healing can begin
