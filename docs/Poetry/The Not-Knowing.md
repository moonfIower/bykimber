there is beauty in the Not-Knowing
the Void carries no fear, no malice, no harm
absence cannot hold what it canâ€™t carry

pretending to know what cannot be known
is like the night feigning to have light
it cannot have

there is a purity in the unknowable
a reverence in its respect

the one truly touchless, soundless thing
it is nothing and everything at once
