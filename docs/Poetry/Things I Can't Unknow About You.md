I went to work today
pretended everything was normal

I talked with my work friends
pretended like I didn't know

We talked about how
you plan to give birth in Utah
the Wyoming hospital is just "not great"
but I know who you voted for

We talked about how
your male boss blamed you
for his dumb mistake again
but I know who you voted for

You complain about the same problems
You wonder if the pattern will ever change
and I listen, I empathize, I make sure you feel heard

and then you vote for a rapist
elect him to the highest office
and celebrate along with the big boss
he brought in donuts for us all

I can't unknow how you struggle
and still chose the means
of your and my destruction

I hear you, I see you
but now I can't unknow
you don't hear us
you don't see us
you're blindly suicidal
and it will slowly kill us all
