I have so much inside me
what, I do not know
are they words, feelings,
demons, they grow

so very swollen, like
they'll burst my seams
I need somewhere to 
put them or I'll scream

and throw them outward
not caring what I hit
but god forbid another 
soul I fail to miss

I want to give these burdens
but also I cannot
no one can be trusted 
in their hands, this heart would rot
