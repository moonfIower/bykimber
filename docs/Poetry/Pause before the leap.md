I thought when I found you
I'd feel different 
I didn't expect to hesitate

we had just started dating
but I already knew this was it
and so I paused and I wondered

what if I love you too much?
what if I lose myself in you

what if I love you more?
what if you can't keep up

what if I found my one and only
and one day you take it away

I paused before the leap
not for any doubt
but because I already knew
just how much I already loved you
