I don't have a mother
and yet I also do

my mother is a mother of 12
a mother 12 times over 
so much a mother
she's the epitome of the word
no one holds the title "mother"
more than her

and yet I don't know her
and she doesn't know me
we're long-time acquaintances
long-term strangers
and I can't be mad because
I know it's not her fault

how do you fit 12 calls 
into a day? 
when is there the time
to visit 12 different homes
across 4 different states?

I know my mother loves me
It's just that she can't be there
for us all
choices have to be made
no love is big enough 
to split a person 12 ways

someone had to sacrifice 
so some could have a mother
I don't remember volunteering
I don't know who decided
It's a burden I was born with
to be what falls to the wayside 
for the epitome of mothers

It's not that she doesn't love me
It's just that she never calls

It's not that she doesn't miss me
It's just that she never visits

It's not that she doesn't care
It's just that she forgets me

and that's fine because
I also don't call or visit or care
