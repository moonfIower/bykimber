I was thinking just the other day
I was thinking about you and me
I think I found my home in you
I think you're all I need

then I think about what you think
I wonder what’s on your mind
I think you think what I think
I think your love is mine

I think I know
I think it’s fine
and then I think
what if?

what if you don't think what I think
what if your words for me
don't match your thoughts of me
what if what I thought I knew
is only what I think

where does thinking end and knowing start
how do I trust in words
without reading your mind

my thoughts get lost in thought
until I'm very far away
then your thoughtful words call me home
and keep my thoughts at bay
