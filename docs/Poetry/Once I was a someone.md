Once I was a someone
Someone that I knew
Once I was a someone
I’m sure you were someone too
I see someone staring
With fiery eyes of black
I think they once were milder
As I sit here thinking back 
A whisper and the passion sways 
I hear her hush my storm
My soul’s gentle keeper
The died-out side I mourn
