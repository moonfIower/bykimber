I sit up straight
to prevent the pain in my back

I hold my head up high
to prevent the pain in my neck 

After several hours,
my back, my neck, 
they're tired. 

I slouch as I sit
to ease the pain in my back.
It makes it worse.

I let my head hang low
to ease the pain in my neck. 
It makes it worse. 

I prop my legs up,
to ease the ache in my veins, 
but the blood wants to flow
not sit, and wait. 

I turn the brightness down
to ease the strain on my eyes,
but my eyes want to look
at anything else. 

My stomach's become bloated
eating all the wrong things.
Chef and nutritionist? 
that's not in my job description.

Stomach acid boils over,
burning my throat.
I'm choking, drowning. 

Muscles all around my head are tense, 
straining my mind.
I'm nauseous, dizzy. 
 
Desperate to let go, 
desperate not to be let go. 
Desperate to live.
