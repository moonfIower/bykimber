I don't actually regret 
A single moment I spent with you

You were my white knight 
My prince charming 
My relief in a time when 
No one chose me 

If I did have any regrets 
It would be the way it ended

Long, slowly, painfully 
For me 
And quickly, overnight, out of nowhere 
Like it was all nothing
For you 

It's just that 

I realized that if God 
Asked you to sacrifice
Your firstborn son
I would want you to choose me
And not God
