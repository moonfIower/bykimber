I built a house within my mind
a quaint little cottage just for me
way up on a tall hill
surrounded by tall forests
covered in ivy and moonflowers
the land cast in perpetual dusk

inside is a little entryway
big enough just for me
a little bench to sit and place my boots
two hooks for my fall and winter coat

to the right an open kitchen
with a little counter, stove, and sink
herbs and pots hang from a trellis
a table for one in a window nook

the other half of my little house
is a library full of books
with eclectic seating everywhere
for when I wish to lie, or sit, or swing

upstairs there's a giant bed
full of plush pillows and quilts
and a night stand with a lamp
shaped like a bluebell

a big wardrobe made of oak
with a million kinds of flowers
both painted and carved
full of sundresses and patchwork pants

an open air shower in one corner
a porcelain tub with a window
sweet smelling potions in beautiful bottles
make the sunlight dance with colors

glass doors lead to a balcony
with a long chair to lounge in the sun
and an easel to paint each new sunrise

down in the basement a root cellar
where garden vegetables keep cold

further down are the files
full of folders from the past

sometimes I go down there to clean house
or add more to the stacks

the mountain where my cottage sits 
keeps people far away
but sometimes different versions of myself
find their way to my front door

sometimes she's little and happy
and we play all day picking posies
sometimes she's little and sad
and I hold her safe inside while it rains 

at times it can be trying
being a big sister to myself
but when she skips home happy
I know I've done enough
