Today I started another spreadsheet
this time titled, "How to Become a Bad Bitch."
It's hidden in a folder with the others
"My Glam Plan"
"How to Be a Hot Girl" 
"Getting My Life Together."

Even though I'm older now 
I have yet to figure it out
the secret, serum, formula, routine 
to being "hot" "sexy" "it."

My partner says not to worry
You're cute 
You're pretty 
You're sweet 

The words toll
like a death bell
or a gavel pronouncing me guilty
of not trying hard enough
to be "what I am."
A kind pointing finger that says 
I'm lazy
resisting my final form.

I won't be done until I find it
the thing I'm missing
but supposed to have.

I was born a woman
born with an obligation 
to be an immortal maiden, vixen, muse. 
It's supposed to be my birthright
to seduce, beguil, enchant.
A power innate to me
as natural as breathing air.

You're a woman after all. 
Go ahead, walk into a room
and a soft breeze will toss your hair
inside a closed building 
as the world moves in slow motion 
defying physics 
and your eyemakeup momentarily 
becomes more intense.

Our horrible secret
is that it's not born in us
but a given obligation 
we're challenged to meet.
And the great irony 
is the prize is being woman enough 
when all I ever wanted
was to be human enough.
