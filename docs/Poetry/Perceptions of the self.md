A young girl looks at herself through a mirror’s silver eye
What she saw was so horrendous, she thought that she would die
A young boy looks at himself through the eyes of all his friends
They picked and they teased at the gimpy way he bends

Both saw those around them as one would see the gods
All their friends were flawless, beating all youth’s odds
They did not see the varying shapes, faces, and kinds of hair
Media never told them that those differences were there

Instead, they fed them man-made boxes that confine
Chains of expectations made by fake images online
A self-made polished prison that has no exit route
Where children go, led by aged hands, never to come out
