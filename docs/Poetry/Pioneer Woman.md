A young woman pioneers across the plains
She's looking for her freedom
She couldn't find it where she was
They scorned what she believed in

Her daughter's daughter decides to leave
the world her mother's mother gave her
Her soul was drowning in the depths of truths they would not say
suffocating in false freedoms 

If I'm so free, so loved, so cherished
then why can I only go so far?

Free girls aren't covered, controlled, and kept
Free girls run with bare feet, loose hair,
and the sun shining warm on their free face

Now I am a free girl
Now I live in all the world
Instead of one small part

Now I live with my soul bare
Now all I show the world is honest
and my own
