 I know of the real snow queens
the ones that live among us

her bright eyes a unique color
a shade between blue and green

her hair a rare shade of flaxen
a long billowing veil of soft gold

her body both voluptuous and thin
a wispy maiden, nymph, or ghost

to watch her is to be mesmerized
to be her is every girlsâ€™ dream

but beneath her prismatic glass skin
burns a fire to kill the girl inside
