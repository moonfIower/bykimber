someday love will happen
but always not today
walls of our own creation
are always in the way

it’s like someone is dangling
your love just out of reach
like it isn’t mine but theirs somehow
and their mercy I must beseech

but some day soon
your love will be mine
and fiercely I do take it

wrapped up in
my covetous arms
I know that we will make it
