sadness floods my house with water
but she's more understanding than most
anger leaves my house cluttered
but she always has my back
boredom leaves the dishes in the sink
but she comes up with the best ideas
anxiety loves to spin tall tales
but she's always the first to warn me


they aren't always good houseguests
these feelings that come to call
but they each have a helpful purpose too
so don't leave them in the hall
