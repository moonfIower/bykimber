Inclusive language is important because it makes content more accessible so it can reach a wider audience. It also protects the company from getting into trouble with compliance or public relations ([see also](https://nasaa-arts.org/nasaa_research/inclusive-language-guide/)).

Using generic male pronouns like "man" and "he" to refer to everyone is no longer common practice.

Most style guides now recommend using more generic pronouns that can easily apply to everyone in a readership like "you, they, them, we, us."

The use of the singular “they” in an instance where gender is not known or not relevant has been in practice since 1375 and is perfectly acceptable to avoid the generic “he” or the clunky “he/she” in singular but gender-neutral references.

Legal copy may prefer to use “he/she” for maximum clarity and specificity.
