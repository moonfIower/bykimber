One-inch margins all around

except for any headers and footers, which are typically half an inch from the edge of the page

One inch is equivalent to 2.54 centimeters or 6 picas; half an inch would be 1.27 cm or 3 picas.

## Front Matter

### 1. Title Page

The title page bears the title, subtitle, author's penname, and possibly the editor's or translator's name. (CMOS 1.19) 

The title page is usually page i.

At the bottom of the title page should be the specific imprint information (Dorrance or RoseDog). 

DORRANCE PUBLISHING CO

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA 15238

Be sure that the title of the book is consistently worded and punctuated everywhere it occurs. 

Please report to the text coordinator any change you have made in the title, even if it is only a comma, so that the covers and publicity material will be consistent with the book.

### 2. Copyright Page

At the top of the copyright page include: 

The following disclaimer should be included on the copyright page for works of fiction:

This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places, and incidents are either the product of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously, and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead; events; or locales is entirely coincidental.

On the copyright page for works of nonfiction, the following disclaimer should be included: 

The opinions expressed herein are those of the author, who assumes complete and sole responsibility for them, and do not necessarily represent the views of the publisher or its agents.

The catch-all disclaimer is used for all RoseDog books. Please see the list of disclaimers if you feel there is another disclaimer that is a more appropriate fit for the Dorrance manuscripts.

ISBN: [insert numbers from the API here]

eISBN: [insert numbers from the API here]

Find the ISBN and eISBN numbers in the API or DPOD document sent along with the first copy of the manuscript. 

### 3. Table of Contents

If the book is to have a table of contents, the copy editor is responsible for creating it and/or seeing that it exactly matches the chapter titles or poem titles in the book and also includes all elements of front matter, text, and back matter appearing after the contents of the book.

### 4. Body Text

The body text of a manuscript should have the following settings: 

- 12 point font 
    
- double spaced 
    
- first line indent (0.50)
    
- left aligned
    

Note: The first paragraph of a new chapter or heading should not have the first line indent. 

#### Page Numbers 

top left- or right-hand corner of the page 

use arabic numerals (1,2,3, etc.)

#### Block Quotes

Use a block quote when the quote is more than 100 words, is several paragraphs long, and for quoted correspondences like letters (especially when a signature is used). 

- leave a blank line before and after the block quote 
    
- indent from the left margin
    
- start a new line
    
- don't use quotation marks 
    
- use the same paragraph breaks in a block quote as the original 
    
- use no indent for the first line
    
- use indents for subsequent paragraphs in the block quote
    
- any intervening words [like "she observed"] should be in brackets when used within a block quote 
    
- block quotes are in Roman type 
    

Introduce block quotes with a period, not a colon, unless the sentence introducing the block quote uses an "as follows" or "the following" type wording. they can also be introduced with a comma (the same rules as regular quotes) 

The beginning letter of a block quote should be lowercase or capitalized depending on whether the syntax with the sentence that introduced it demands it

- if the block quote is running text than lowercase 
    
- if the block quote is introduced with a colon or period than capitalize
    

Don't indent the paragraph after a block quote if it is a continuation of the paragraph that introduced the block quote. put an indent if it is a new paragraph. (this decision is usually made by the author - otherwise make a choice) 

Block quote citations are in parenthesis at the end of the block quote, in line with the block quote, after the final period in the block quote. 

#### Dialogue

New speakers should always start a new line. Use a comma to introduce speakers in dialogue (CMOS 6.53). 

Garret replied, "I hope you are not referring to me." 

#### Numerals in Dialogue 

Generally, numerals in dialogue can be spelled out, years can be numerals, and longer lists of numbers can also be numerals. (CMOS 13.44)

#### Multiple Paragraphs in Dialogue 

Use blocks quotes whenever possible for dialogue with numerous paragraphs. Otherwise, a quotation mark should be used at the beginning of each new paragraph, but only at the end of the final paragraph. (CMOS 13.32)

#### Letters

Letters should always be set off as a block quote. (CMOS 13.35)

#### Poetry

The best way to handle poetry is to concentrate primarily on spelling, leaving punctuation, capitalization, and spacing mostly up to the author. 

Any style of capitalization is acceptable in poetry, but make it consistent. 

Aim for defined sentences set in verse and a clear statement of the author's message.

For poetry quoted in running text, mark a new poetry line with a space / space. You should only use at most two lines of poetry in run-in text, otherwise, it should be offset as a blockquote. 

#### Narrated Thoughts

Thoughts are either consistently in quotes or not in quotes. It's usually up to the author's preference. If a thought starts mid-sentence, the first letter should be capitalized. (CMOS 13.43)

#### Section Breaks

Use three asterisks or stars, centered, to mark a section break in a manuscript. (CMOS 1.58)

* * *

#### Chapter, poem, section titles

(CMOS 2.58) The chapter titles or poem titles are to be set in capital and lowercase letters. 

A Life Worth Dying For, The Woods Within

Numbered chapter headings, such as Chapter Two, are to be written out and center-aligned.

Begin chapters on a new page. (CMOS 2.17)

### 5. Back Matter

Back ad copy will usually consist of two parts: 

1. a section about the book 
    
2. a section about the author
    

The total of both sections should be no more than 200 words. You will find that most of your word count will be in the ATB. It's much easier to keep the ATA short.

#### About the Book

The About the Book (ATB) should be viewed as a sales tool. You want to make the person reading the about the book section want to buy the book. We have found it helpful to avoid a book summary, even in the case of fiction. Pick a few themes and focus on them. Remember, the object is to attract readers, not summarize the plot. 

#### About the Author

You will be given biographical information to use in writing the About the Author (ATA) when the Author's Publishing Information (API) is submitted by the author. 

We ask that this section be separate and have the title "About the Author" typed above it. 

#### Bibliography

In the bibliography, the books are listed in alphabetical order according to the last name. To assure consistency, brevity, and simplicity, the style and the elements to be included somewhat echo those of the notes and footnotes. The following order and style is to be observed:

#### Citing Sources

All citations and sources must not be older than a year. 

#### Citations in Running Text

Books and periodical titles are italicized. 

There is a book called the Unbanking of America that perfectly explains the concept of being unbanked. 

Articles and chapter titles are enclosed in double quotation marks.

For more information about how to write checks read, "How to Write a Check: A Check Cashing Guide." 

In-text citations should be in parentheses after the content they are citing, and include the last name of the author. 

Accreditation refers to a school's status with the US Department of Education (Clark).

For in-text citations on website content, you can also make the citation a link or simply link the source in relevant words found in the running text.

Note: If a more complex reference style appears and the style here will not suffice, consult the Chicago Manual of Style under the proper heading. If reference is made to unpublished material, the same basic form is followed: the tide of the work is in quotation marks and is followed by a period, and the nature or form of the unpublished material is noted. The university or college is also noted if the material is a dissertation and is concluded with the date of completion.

#### Footnotes and Endnotes

The editing and style of an author's notes many times leave the editor in a quagmire. In order to save the editor from deciding among the different styles supported by various manuals, the following style is to be observed for its universal acceptability, brevity, and simplicity of form.

#### Citation of Website

Lastname, Firstname. “Title of Web Page.” Name of Website. Publishing organization, publication or revision date if available. Access date if no other date is available. URL .

#### First citation of book

2. Tom Dooly, "Lay Down My Head and Cry," Kingston Trio Weekly 16 April 1953: 45-90.
    

Note: If a magazine article is one that begins in the front and finishes in the back of the magazine, the page numbers are meaningless and should be omitted.

#### Shortened forms for repeated references

- After the fast occurrence of a reference, only the last name of the author needs to be repeated, unless there is a reference in the notes to another author of the same last name or there are listings for more than one book by the same author.
    
- A shortened form of an especially long title could be established and used consistently in subsequent references.
    
- Use ibid. and op. cit. correctly.
    

- Ibid. ("in the same place," "in the same book") refers to the work in the footnote immediately preceding. When ibid. is used, only that information from the foregoing reference needs to be added because ibid. takes the place of all words that are identical in consecutive notes.
    
- Op. cit. ("in the work cited") may be used with the name of the author when a footnote refers to a work previously mentioned but not immediately preceding.
    
- Loc. cit. ("in the place cited") may be used when a footnote refers to a periodical or an article that has been already cited in full.
    

For example:

1. Snoop Doggy Dogg with Vanilla Ice, Choosing Your Rap Moniker (St. Louis: Yanni Press, 1995) 34-36.
    
2. Michael Stephen Angelo, All the Groovy Modern Painters (Stamford, Connecticut: Bristol Publishing, 1978) 89-90.
    
3. Ibid., 55.
    
4. Dogg, Op. cit., 95.
    

Note: After the first occurrence, publishing information should not be repeated, and if the book has a bibliography, the publishing information can be omitted entirely when given in the bibliography.

#### Local court documents

- Case name (in Roman type), followed by a comma Docket number
    
- Name of court
    
- Date of decision (in parentheses), followed by a period.
    

For example:

1. Bridges vs. Madison County, 314 U.S. 252 (1941).
    
2. United States vs. Devious Dennis, 183 E2d 201 (2d Cit.) 1950.
    

#### State court documents

- Case name (in Roman type), followed by a comma
    
- Volume, followed by a comma
    
- Page
    
- Date of decision (in parentheses)
    

#### Charts, Graphs, Tables, and Figures 

See the "Numbers" section for more rules about writing numbers. 

- All tables, graphs, charts, lists, and figures should be able to stand alone. When including numbers, use a number format that is both consistent and simple. 
    
- If some numbers in a section of the chart have decimal numbers then include decimal placeholders for all numbers in that section.
    
- If all numbers within a section of a chart do not have decimal numbers, the decimal place is not necessary for any of the numbers in that section. 
    
- Avoid omitting numerical symbols (like dollar signs or percentage symbols) even if the heading suggests the necessary numerical symbols. 
    
- When the same word is repeated throughout a series in a table or chart, it can often be omitted or simplified somehow. 
    
- For other similarities within a series, something can often be simplified for better graph, chart, or table reading.
