Here I have stored all my favorite writing tips I've learned on my own or from other great writers. But at the end of the day, if you remember any writing tips, remember the 4 Principles of Good Writing. 

Good writing is . . . 
1. simple 
2. clear 
3. consistent
4. meaningful

## The Simple Writing Principle
Remember the KISS acronym. **Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)**, right? The entire point of writing is to communicate something, whether that's a story or a corporate email. So simple writing is better writing because it's better communication. 

> Tip: The best tip for simple writing is to try and make sure each sentence is only conveying one idea and not trying to fit two or more ideas into a single sentence.

> Tip: Another tip for simple writing is to not have more than one sentence for each idea. Reduce redundant sentences that are just reiterating the same thing. 

**Complex Example:** If you’ve been wondering how to change careers for a while you might make the mistake of rushing into the first opportunity that comes your way and switching to a new career can be a huge change in your life, and that change can bring uncertainty and unwanted stress. It’s easy to get caught up in the necessary steps involved in changing careers, and ignore the things that are important for your health.

**Simple Example:** Switching careers can be stressful. Don't rush into the first new opportunity that comes your way. Instead, take the time you need to figure out what you want in a new career. 

## The Clear Writing Principle
If the entire point of writing is to communicate something, then clear writing is better writing because it's also better communication. Clear writing avoids ambiguity, misunderstandings, or double meanings. 

> Tip: Reread all your writing out loud to help detect any potential confusion in the way you outlined the information. 

**Unclear Example:** She saw the man with the telescope.

In this sentence, there are several interpretations a reader could make. Maybe she saw a man who had a telescope or maybe she saw the man using a telescope. 

**Clear Example:** Using her telescope, she saw a man walking on the beach.

Now we have more context to know exactly what was going on in this sentence. 

## The Consistent Writing Principle
Writing, just like communication in general, has all kinds of patterns and formulas. Keep these patterns consistent so that your writing flows seamlessly. 

> Tip: Make your writing consistent by using the principles of parallelism in your writing. 

**What is parallelism?** Parallelism is the use of similar patterns, grammar, structure, and rhythm in writing.

**Nonparallel Example:** She enjoys reading, hiking, and to swim.

This nonparallel writing example sounds clunky because the third verb doesn't match the same verb structure that the rest of the verbs are using.

**Parallel Example:** She enjoys reading, hiking, and swimming.

Doesn't that sound more natural? That's because this writing example uses parallel structure when it gives all the verbs in the sentence the same form. 

So the next time you feel like your writing sounds a little clunky, think about the structure of each sentence and word and if they match or not. 

## The Meaningful Writing Principle
Don't waste your time or your reader's time with fluff. Each sentence should have its own clear meaning and purpose. Short, well-written, purposeful content is always better than long, badly-written, purposeless content. 

> Tip: Give each sentence a clear purpose and cut out any words, phrases, or sentences that don't add to this purpose.
## Show vs Tell
To show not tell, you want to be purposeful in how much information you provide and how you provide that information.

- Be purposeful in how much detail you provide 
- Be purposeful in how you provide details
- Leave room for the reader’s imagination
- Scatter information throughout the story
- Avoid monologuing 
- Don't describe the way characters look too much 
- Don’t introduce new characters by having them tell their entire life story in one sitting.
- Use the information you need to convey to brainstorm major and minor plot points.

## Make & Keep Promises to the Reader 
Every piece of written content has an intent, promises that are made to the reader that needs to be fulfilled and satisfied. 

## Spell it out.
Novels like to have spelled-out words rather than symbols, abbreviations, etc. 

- Spell out numbers unless they are complex or use decimals
- Spell out money and "dollars" etc. 
- Spell out abbreviations 
- Use "to" instead of an en dash between numbers
- Say the state name instead of the abbreviation

## Focus on what matters most.
A lot of great art is actually quite blurry around the edges. Not all the details matter so spend your energy on the ones that do. Above all, be the reader as you write and focus on the details that the reader will see and not so much on the details you care about as the god and creator of this universe. 

## Add secrets and mysteries.
People are intrigued by secrets and mysteries, but not secrets and mysteries that have no answers, or rather, no satisfaction of any kind. People want to enjoy a sense of completion, they want to come full circle, they want to figure things out, not just have things to figure out. 

## Readers love pain.
But not because they actually love pain, but they love the things that come around pain. They love justified pity, they love the validation that comes when you've been wronged and someone somewhere understands and feels for that wrong—even if that someone is the reader of this pained character's book. 

## Readers want everything to be delicious.
Even their vegetables. Authors can make that happen. They can even make fight scenes delicious. They can make explanations delectable. They can make conflict taste divine. Sometimes it's not that what your consuming is good for anyone, but in some way or another, it's delicious anyway. 

## Facilitate Reader Insertion. 
Reader insertion is the bible of writing long-form literature. The reason anyone dedicates their precious time to long-form literature these days is because in some way they are mentally able to insert themselves into the story or into a character's shoes. Reader insertion is the lifeblood of what makes good writing good and good writing work so well. People want to be seen, they want to be understood, they want to be felt for. 

## Readers want to feel emotions when they read.
They want to feel all the things. They want to feel pain, sadness, anger. The biggest fun of reading is feeling everything from rage to passion. The idea that evoking positive emotions will lead to positive results does not exist in writing. Our readers want to feel it all. 

## Maintain the Reader's Trance/Suspension of Disbelief
The trance, the suspension of disbelief, whatever it is something happens when you're reading that puts your brain into a certain kind of mental space. Things in a book need to at least make enough sense that it never takes the reader out of that trance. Being jostled out of the astral plane can be jarring and at best, annoying. When something snaps us out of that trance, that willing suspension of disbelief falters and we begin to feel "we're being lied to." elements of the story become difficult to digest, to wrap our minds around, and the fabrication of it all becomes more apparent. Obviously all of it is a fabrication, but that willing suspension of disbelief isn't really done on purpose. Its a willful suspension not a forced suspension. The mind of the reader gives consent to be entranced and roll with the flow of the story when done right. 

## Be wary committing to unforgivables.
Be wary of putting things in your writing that can't be easily forgiven by your reader. Like the dog theory, you don't ever kill the dog because it's hard for the reader to forgive. If you think about it, this just falls again into the idea of the readers trance and not breaking it.

## Writing Women
Women are just people. If this comes as a surprise to you then you have no business writing women at all and need to go make friends with womankind first.

Women are not a special brand of the human species, they are not man-adjacent, man being the original "human."

All the failings of male authors writing female characters boil down to them seeing women as a subclass species of human beings and not just human beings. 

Differing experiences and being completely different animals are two vastly different conditions. A mouse experiences a much different life than I do, but that's not what makes a mouse different from me.

If you still have trouble understanding, give your female characters male names and write them as male characters. Then change their names at the end using the Find + Replace tool. Now you'll save yourself from subconsciously creating female characters that are so "other" they barely even qualify as supporting characters.

## Info Dumping vs Info Scattering
The primary way you avoid info dumping is by learning how to info *scatter* instead. The primary way to successfully scatter information throughout your story is to utilize situational learning. 

**Situational learning** is a type of learning that happens through situations, coming upon information through events, relationships, and connected context clues.

In real life, when you learn something about the world or learn more about a friend or family member's backstory, you rarely learn that lore because they randomly decided to tell you all of it, all at once, in one sitting.

> In real life, more often than not, you learn information about people and the world around you situationally, piece by piece, here and there, and as you connect bits of information and context clues together.

For example, you learn that your friend Susan doesn't like heights because she's the only one who didn't show up to the group hike on Saturday or because when the hike Susan did agree to turned out to be much higher than she realized, Susan panicked and froze and it took you 30 minutes to talk her back down the path. 

You'll rarely learn information like this because someone randomly decided to tell you the detailed backstories and phobias of everyone in your friend group one evening.

Situational learning can be used in story writing too.

> Instead of writing long pages where a knowledgeable character narrates lots of information all at once, use the need to convey this information to plot your story's major and minor events. 

Write so that as things happen within the story, we stumble upon a nugget of information here and there, like a scavenger hunt.
