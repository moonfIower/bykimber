Welcome to my Writing Guide. Here you'll find a complete field guide to everything I've ever learned about writing and storytelling. I try to keep these guides as bare bones as possible so we get right to the key information without too much fluff. We'll go over everything from all the steps to writing a book to genre guidelines to remember and figures of speech. 

Thank you for reading, I hope you find something here helpful, and feel free to follow and find me at any of the social links below!
