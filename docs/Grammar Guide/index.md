Welcome to my Grammar Guide. Here you'll find a complete field guide to everything I've ever learned about grammar and copyediting. I try to keep these guides as bare bones as possible so we get right to the key information without too much fluff. We'll go over everything from proofreading for spelling to the differences between perspective, tense, and tone. 

Thank you for reading, I hope you find something here helpful, and feel free to follow and find me at any of the social links below!
