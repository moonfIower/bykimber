phrases of speech are essentially what we call different types of words, or "the vocabulary of words."
## Antecedent
An antecedent is the **noun** a *pronoun* is referencing.
**Mark** wanted to prove *he* could do it alone.

The antecedent should be mentioned before the pronoun used to replace it to avoid ambiguity.

NO: *He* wanted to prove *he* could do it alone. (who is "he" in this sentence?)
YES: **Mark** wanted to prove *he* could do it alone. (now we know "he" refers to "Mark" in this sentence)
## Contractions
A contraction is a word that shortens a word or two-word phrase by omitting certain letters and usually uses an apostrophe in place of those omitted letters ([see also](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/contractions/)).

*don't, I'm, they're*
## Conjunctions
linking words, phrases, and structures that link other words, phrases, or parts of a sentence together. Conjunctions come in three categories ([see also](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/conjunctions/)):
- coordinating
- correlative
- subordinate

| **Type of Conjunction**    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Coordinating Conjunctions  | These ==conjunctions== show how **one item** coordinates with *another item*.<br><br>I like **apples**, ==but== not *bananas*.<br><br>*for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Correlative Conjunctions   | These ==conjunctions== show how **one item** correlates to *another item*. <br><br>I like ==both== **bananas** and *apples*.<br><br>*both/and, either/or, neither/nor, not only/but, whether/or*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Direct Objects
The object in a sentence that is being referred to or acted upon directly, usually a **noun, pronoun, or noun phrase**. Meanwhile, prepositional phrases, adjectives, and adverbs are NOT direct objects.
## Slang, Jargon, Idioms
**Slang** is trending language. 
**Jargon** is language used within a specific field, or "work slang."
**Idioms** are a fancy word for an **expression** or **phrase of speech**, a group of words that take on a specific meaning when they are together. 
## Modifiers
This is what you call words or phrases that "modify" another word in the sentence. A modifier is **a word or phrase that changes, clarifies, qualifies, limits, or describes another word** in a sentence. Modifiers tend to be adverbs and adjectives or adverbial phrases and adjective clauses ([see also](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/modifiers/)).
### Misplaced Modifiers
Modifiers should always be as close to **the thing they modify** as possible to avoid ambiguity. Modifiers that aren't close enough to what they modify are called "misplaced" modifiers.

NO: They bought a **car** for my sister ==they call Pumpkin==.
YES: They bought a **car** ==they call Pumpkin== for my sister.

(The car is called Pumpkin, but in the first sentence, since this modifying phrase is so far from the word "car" it's unclear if "Pumpkin" is maybe what the sister is called.)
### Limiting Modifiers
This type of ==modifier== puts restrictions on **something** in the sentence.

==Only== Jessica wants **pizza**.
Jessica ==only== wants **pizza**.
## Prepositions
prepositions are connector words.

*at / by / down / for / from / in / into / like / near / of / off / on / onto / over / past / to / upon / with*
## Participles
When a verb is used as an adjective or used in a "to be" phrase, it's called a PARTICIPLE.

Present Participles end in -ING
I saved the starving dog.

Past Participles end in -ED
I saved the starved dog.
## Verbs

## Capitalization
Capitalize all proper nouns.
*names, holidays, religions, organizations, countries, languages, days of the week, months, races, ethnicities, nationalities*

Capitalization can also be used for emphasis, especially in ad copy or designs. Otherwise, use capitalization for emphasis sparingly. 

**Tip:** if you're not sure if a noun is in an instance where it should be capitalized or not, you can sometimes know it needs to be capitalized if you can put "the" in front of it or if it is talking about "the" thing and not just any version of that thing.

For example, if you're referring to THE Army of the US, then capitalize the word Army, but if you are just talking about armies in general, then lowercase it.
## Titles and Offices
Titles and offices are capitalized when they precede a proper noun (someone's name) and not when they are used alone. 

Before you can post online you need permission from President Jane.

You can ask the president for permission.
## Titles and Headings
Most words in a title should be capitalized. Connecting words (prepositions and conjunctions) are not capitalized in a title unless they are the first word: 

*at / by / down / for / from / in / into / like / near / of / off / on / onto / over / past / to / upon / with / and / as / but / for / if / nor / once / or / so / than / that / till / when / yet*

Capitalize both words in hyphenated compounds within a title or heading. 

NO: Make Exercise a **Life-long** Habit
YES: Make Exercise a **Life-Long** Habit

Lowercase both letters in the abbreviation for versus (vs) in titles and headings. The abbreviation vs also doesn't need any periods. 

NO: Baseball **Vs.** Soccer 
YES: Baseball **vs** Soccer
