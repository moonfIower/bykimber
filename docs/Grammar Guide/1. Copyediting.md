A soft hyphen is dropped in the final copy if the hyphenated word falls on one line; a hard hyphen is always retained no matter how the word falls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| extract                | Quoted passage set off from the running text. Extracts are often set in a smaller type size and on a shorter measure than the running text.
