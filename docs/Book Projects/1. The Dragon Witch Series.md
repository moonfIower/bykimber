## The Dragon Witch (Dragon Witch 1)
**Status:** completed, currently in developmental editing

**Publish Date:** August 2025

Arlo Silverbane didn't have a lot of experience with belonging. But that didn't matter so long as she fulfilled her role, as the most promising up-and-coming hunter in the Norwen witch hunting clan. Her sole purpose is to track down and eviscerate the demon familiars the witches of long ago left behind, and she's damn good at her job. That is, until she's accused of being one of them, one of the very things she was raised to hunt and kill . . .
