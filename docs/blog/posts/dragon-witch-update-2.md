# Dragon Witch Update 2

Book 1 of the Dragon Witch Trilogy is officially done and in the beta reading and developmental editing process. This means that book 1 of the Dragon Witch is nearing completion and nearing publication! 

I now have beta readers reading book 1 and actively sending me back their notes and feedback. As soon as these beta reader and other developmental edits are done I will then format my book for publishing and start the final proofreading process. 

As of right now, the first book of the Dragon Witch series is on track to be published next August 2025.
