# Morning Pages

Morning pages are a morning ritual that involves stream of conscious writing for a set amount of time or set amount of pages. It's an activity to engage your creative flow. I find myself feeling the most energized, productive, and creative in the early morning hours when the day is fresh and new and in general, love to work in this timeframe. 

Hence the name I chose for my newsletter, Kimber's *Morning Pages*.
