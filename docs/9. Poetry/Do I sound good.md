Do I sound good? 
I sit amidst a choir
One voice in a sea of sound 
I drown and no one hears me
I'm a sound within a sound 

Do I sound good? 
I want to sound good
To be a voice that stands out 
Enough to be seen 
And praised and worthy 

I'm afraid that I don't sound good 
But still I have to try 
I'll practice and pretend
Until my voice learns to burn 
Like fire from the son 

Will I ever sound good? 
I want to want this
So badly that I think I do 
For so long I live like that 
Lost in lies I can't hear 

I don't sound good
My voice is not a songbird's
My call has no fire 
To burn the hearts 
Of those that follow him 

But I am not a voice for fire
I do not call the heavens down 
I am a voice for water and the moon 
I call only for myself and mine

Sounding good no longer matters 
My voice no longer strains
Swimming lost amidst the choir 
I am my own current 
and I am my own voice
