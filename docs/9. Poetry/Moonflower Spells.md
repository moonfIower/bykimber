## Unpeopled 
I am unpeopled

there is no one on me
or in me
or around

no one can touch me

I stand alone
on my own solid ground
## I Am Unfettered 
I am unfettered 
Unattached 
Detangled from 
The woes of man 
I fly free 
Above it all
## A Prayer to Gaia for Blessings
Gaia bless us
with warmth from your sun 
with joy from your fruits
with health from your grains 
what we may live each day 
in balance with the Goddess
## A Prayer to Gaia for Help 
Gaia help us
keep us safe from chaos 
keep our world in balance 
give us might in the darkness 
fill our nights with moonlight
and guide us toward the stars
## Gaia's Baby Blessing 
Gaia bless this babe 
Let her time on this earth 
Be full of joy 
Let her form on this earth 
Be full of strength 
## Gaia guide your children 
To love her as I love her 
To protect her as I protect her
To support her as I support her 
For all her days 
Child Grow
Child grow
Be steady like a mountain 
Let your depths grow deep 
Like a river in a monsoon
Reach heights like a tree 
With no roots 
## This Day Is Mine
This day is mine 
and no one else's 
I own today
I own this moment 
I am the maker of my time 
## Step into the void
step into the void with me
leave them all behind
any attention
gives them life
let us let them die
## Thank You, Past
thank you, Past
for the good I can take from you

goodbye, Past
for the bad I no longer carry

I am full of the good
I am devoid of the bad
I am my own Present
## Let Go of Anger
cast off my wrath
let it be done
clothe me in
a brighter sun
Courage Spell 
strength and courage
may I possess
to face what I fear
to break through to bravery
and become my own hero
## A spell to stop complaining 
I need to stop complaining
acting like it's raining
when the sun is out there waiting
for my feet to walk outside
## A spell to stop grumbling 
I make my own sunshine
I can stop the rain
this gloomy day
is mine to make
and mine to throw away
A spell to put out good energy 
I am the color orange
I am warm and mellow and sweet
orange fills my every corner
and flows from me to the world
where everything I touch
turns orange too
