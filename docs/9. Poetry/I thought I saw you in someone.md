I thought I saw you in someone
I thought I recognized your eyes
I thought the feeling was familiar 
So my hope began to rise 

But I guess I was mistaken
I really thought it was you 
Now I'm not sure who you are
Or what I'm supposed to do 

For a while after that
My heart was sore
And I felt foolish 

Now I feel relief 
That I didn't choose a stranger 
While I waited for you.
