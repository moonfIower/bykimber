I like to think that Mother
When we first became Her spirits
Went about the universe 
Finding all our parts 
She'd gently take each sinew
wrap them all together
and when she felt us finished 
She'd wrap us up in Her embrace
holding us close inside her
until our souls knit perfectly together 
and in that still, serene, premortal moment
we very first became a being.
