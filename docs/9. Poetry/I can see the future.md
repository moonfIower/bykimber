I can see the future
I can read your mind 

I know what will happen next 
I've known it for some time

what would be a gift in a fairy tale
is a curse when brought out here

I know one day my mother will call
and it will be to tell me my father's dead
so now every time my mother calls
my chest fills up with dread

I don't get to know the bright moments
those I can only guess
what I get to know are burdens
that leave me in a mess

I'd much prefer the not-knowing
sweet ignorance is bliss

the curse of too much knowing
is not a gift I'd miss
