*September 24, 2024*

I'm currently writing a fantasy trilogy about the four witches of the apocalypse who are destined to bring about the end of the world, and one young huntress's journey to stop them. 

Right now I am currently working on writing The Wolf Witch, book 2 of the Dragon Witch series. This week I am specifically working on **chapters 11 to 15**.

I have a schedule outlined where if I write 2 chapters a week, then I should be done writing book 2 by this December. But I've already fallen a bit behind as I've needed time to brainstorm through some plot things.

Sometimes I feel like half of writing is brainstorming through roadblocks where you can't quite see the road ahead. Anyway, here's the current status of the series to help keep me accountable and offer an update to any interested readers: 

**Estimated Publish Date:**Â November 2025
