**Total Word Count:** 40,000 words
**Overall Book Progress:** 39% complete

As I work on reviewing and editing The Dragon Witch (book 1), I am beginning work on completing my work in progress and the second book in the The Dragon Witch trilogy: _The Wolf Witch_

If I write 1,000 words a day then I'll have this second book done by the end of April. That's the goal anyway, stay tuned to see how I do!

I found a neat writing app today called, Wave Writer, and I really liked using it. It's a distraction-free writing tool with a super simple writing interface and a wave that moves in correspondence with your typing.

Something about the typing wave really helped me focus on my typing, as it showed my typing in this neat visual way. I'm trying to focus more when I'm writing so I don't get lost in backtracking and line editing and this app really helped me do that.

Do you have a favorite writing program? I've heard great things about Scrivener and LivingWriter but I can't get myself to pay for them. Maybe they're worth the price though and I should give one a go.
