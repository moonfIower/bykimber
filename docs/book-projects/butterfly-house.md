# Butterfly House

The Butterfly House is a standalone fantasy novel about fairy myths old and new, and what happens when a modern day girl with an honest love for art finds out there's more to who she is then she could have ever imagined. 

### Book Progress

Current Status = backlogged. I'm trying to focus more in my writing endeavors to actually start completing projects instead of endlessly starting new ones. So until the Dragon Witch series is published, this next project will be on the backburner for now.

## The Butterfly House
**Status:** in progress, 13% complete

**Publish Date:** TBA

Diana is a modest girl with a great passion for the arts who, through a great deal of fortune on her side, finds herself invited to the most elite art gala with the most prestigious patrons of the arts in attendance. Little does she know, the mysterious Lord Huron has his own ideas about Diana's involvement in his art collection, and fortune had little to do with how Diana got that invitation.
