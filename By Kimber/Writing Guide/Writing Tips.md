## Show vs Tell
To show not tell, you want to be purposeful in how much information you provide and how you provide that information.

- Be purposeful in how much detail you provide 
- Be purposeful in how you provide details
- Leave room for the reader’s imagination
- Scatter information throughout the story
- Avoid monologuing 
- Don't describe the way characters look too much 
- Don’t introduce new characters by having them tell their entire life story in one sitting.
- Use the information you need to convey to brainstorm major and minor plot points.
## Writing Women
Women are just people. If this comes as a surprise to you then you have no business writing women at all and need to go make friends with womankind first.

Women are not a special brand of the human species, they are not man-adjacent, man being the original "human."

All the failings of male authors writing female characters boil down to them seeing women as a subclass species of human beings and not just human beings. 

Differing experiences and being completely different animals are two vastly different conditions. A mouse experiences a much different life than I do, but that's not what makes a mouse different from me.

If you still have trouble understanding, give your female characters male names and write them as male characters. Then change their names at the end using the Find + Replace tool. Now you'll save yourself from subconsciously creating female characters that are so "other" they barely even qualify as supporting characters.

### Make & Keep Promises to the Reader 
Every piece of written content has an intent, promises that are made to the reader that needs to be fulfilled and satisfied. 

### Spell it out.
Novels like to have spelled-out words rather than symbols, abbreviations, etc. 

- Spell out numbers unless they are complex or use decimals
- Spell out money and "dollars" etc. 
- Spell out abbreviations 
- Use "to" instead of an en dash between numbers
- Say the state name instead of the abbreviation

### Focus on what matters most.
A lot of great art is actually quite blurry around the edges. Not all the details matter so spend your energy on the ones that do. Above all, be the reader as you write and focus on the details that the reader will see and not so much on the details you care about as the god and creator of this universe. 

### Add secrets and mysteries.
People are intrigued by secrets and mysteries, but not secrets and mysteries that have no answers, or rather, no satisfaction of any kind. People want to enjoy a sense of completion, they want to come full circle, they want to figure things out, not just have things to figure out. 

### People love pain.
But not because they actually love pain, but they love the things that come around pain. They love justified pity, they love the validation that comes when you've been wronged and someone somewhere understands and feels for that wrong—even if that someone is the reader of this pained character's book. 

### People want everything to be delicious.
Even their vegetables. Authors can make that happen. They can even make fight scenes delicious. They can make explanations delectable. They can make conflict taste divine. Sometimes it's not that what your consuming is good for anyone, but in some way or another, it's delicious anyway. 

### Facilitate Reader Insertion. 
Reader insertion is the bible of writing long-form literature. The reason anyone dedicates their precious time to long-form literature these days is because in some way they are mentally able to insert themselves into the story or into a character's shoes. Reader insertion is the lifeblood of what makes good writing good and good writing work so well. People want to be seen, they want to be understood, they want to be felt for. 

### People want to feel emotions when they read.
They want to feel all the things. They want to feel pain, sadness, anger. The biggest fun of reading is feeling everything from rage to passion. The idea that evoking positive emotions will lead to positive results does not exist in writing. Our readers want to feel it all. 

### Maintain the Reader's Trance/Suspension of Disbelief
The trance, the suspension of disbelief, whatever it is something happens when you're reading that puts your brain into a certain kind of mental space. Things in a book need to at least make enough sense that it never takes the reader out of that trance. Being jostled out of the astral plane can be jarring and at best, annoying. When something snaps us out of that trance, that willing suspension of disbelief falters and we begin to feel "we're being lied to." elements of the story become difficult to digest, to wrap our minds around, and the fabrication of it all becomes more apparent. Obviously all of it is a fabrication, but that willing suspension of disbelief isn't really done on purpose. Its a willful suspension not a forced suspension. The mind of the reader gives consent to be entranced and roll with the flow of the story when done right. 

### Be wary committing to unforgivables.
Be wary of putting things in your writing that can't be easily forgiven by your reader. Like the dog theory, you don't ever kill the dog because it's hard for the reader to forgive. If you think about it, this just falls again into the idea of the readers trance and not breaking it.
