## Affect vs Effect
| **Affect**                    | **Effect**                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| is a verb, an action.         | is a noun, something that comes from a "cause and effect," the result of an action, not the action itself. |
Confusion arises because affect can also be a noun and effect can also be a verb. But usually, you're safe to use affect as a verb and effect as a noun. 

When unsure about which to use, you can always use the word "impact" instead.

## Into vs In To

## Lay vs Lie
| **Lay**                                                                                                                    | **Lie**                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| to lay an **object** down, to put, or to place.                                                                            | to lie down as a **person**, "lie" is a reflexive verb meaning to rest or to recline.                     |
| (pres) I lay it down.<br>(past) I laid it down.<br>(pres part) It had been laid down.<br>(past part) I was laying it down. | (pres) I lie down.<br>(past) I lay down.<br>(pres part) I had lain down.<br>(past part) I was lying down. |
Confusion arises because "(pres) I lay it down" and "(past) I lay down" use the same spelling but are different tenses. 

**A quicker guide:** 
lay = objects (pres) OR people (past)

laid = objects only (past, pres part)
laying = objects only (past part)

lie = people only (pres)
lain = people only (pres part)
lying = people only (past part)

it's often better sounding to avoid present and past participles anyway so: 

lay = objects (pres) OR people (past)
lie = people only (pres)
laid = objects only (past)

## Leftover vs Left Over
| **Leftover**                                    | **Left Over**                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1 word when used as an **adjective**.           | 2 words when used as a **verb phrase**.        |
| This **leftover** *money* will help the family. | That money *was* **left over** from yesterday. |

## Lightning vs Lightening
| **Lightning**                                    | **Lightening**                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| the flash of light in a storm.                   | to lighten.                                      |
| I saw **lightning** during the storm last night. | The lightning last night, **lightened** the sky. |
## May vs Might
| **May**                                              | **Might**                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| used when asking **permission**.                     | used when talking about **possibilities**.            |
| **May** I help you fill out this loan application*?* | This loan **might** *not be available* in your state. |
## Opt
The word opt never needs a hyphen. 
"Opt" is not an abbreviation for "option," but is its own verb meaning "to make a choice."
So verb phrases like "opt in" do not need a hyphen and using a hyphen is actually an overcorrection.
## Proceed vs Precede
| **Proceed**                                                                                         | **Precede**                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| after, going forward, the following.<br><br>She’ll **proceed** to the Miss Alabama pageant in June. | before<br><br>January **precedes** February. |

## Sparing vs Sparring
| **Sparing**                     | **Sparring**                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |

| Ryan spent money **sparingly**. | Ryan and Rebecca were **sparring** with swords. |
## Shined vs Shone

| **shined** is used when acting on an *object.* | **shone** is used when not acting on an object |
| I **shined** the *shoes*.                      | The shoes **shone** brightly.                  |

## That vs Which

| You CAN'T pull the "that" statement out and still have a complete sentence | You CAN pull the "which" statement out and still have a complete sentence |

## Toward NOT Towards
Adding an "s" to the end of words that end in "-ward" is an unnecessary overcorrection.

## Commonly Confused Phrases

### There are times when
NOT "There are times where"
because you are talking about when, not where with time.

### In Time vs On Time
in time = early enough, not late
on time = punctual, according to the schedule
